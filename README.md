# Rational Determinant

## Find determinant of matrix of rational entries with arbitrary precision integers

> This project is the lab assignment for week-11 at IISER Bhopal 2nd semester (2022-23)

The project involves the following sub-parts:

1. Create a `struct` which can store integers of arbitrary length, with their signs
2. Implement this `struct` to perform arithmetic calculations on the integers
3. Implement the `struct` to create another `struct` that stores a rational number (numerator and denominator)
4. Implement arithmetic operations on these Rational `structs` as well
5. Using all of the above, calculate the determinant of a `nxn` matrix with `Rational` elements
6. Finally, calculate the inverse of a `Rational` matrix with all the implementations created above
